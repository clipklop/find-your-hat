### Game: Find your Hat

#### A tiny maze-like terminal game

##### It was developed to brush up my JS skill ;)

### Possible improvements:
- [ ] Have the character start on a random location that’s not the upper-left corner.
- [ ] Create a “hard mode” where one or more holes are added after certain turns.
- [ ] Improve your game’s graphics and interactivity in the terminal. There are many helpful packages to assist with this, and you can really get creative with how you approach terminal games.
- [ ] Create a field validator to ensure that the field generated by Field.generateField() can actually be solved. You’ll essentially be creating a version of a maze solver.
